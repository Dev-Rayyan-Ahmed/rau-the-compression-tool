# RAU: The Compressor

RAU is a file compression tool that uses the **Huffman Algorithm** to compress any text file.

This project was created to meet the requirements of the **Data Structures and Algorithm Classes** at **NED University of Engineering and Technology**. Building this tool is a great way to learn and understand how real-world compression works.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This tool is a multi-language project, using the following technologies:

* **Python:** Used for implementing the core compression and decompression logic (the Huffman algorithm).
* **Node.js / Electron:** Used for creating the desktop application, which allows access to the computer's **Operating System (OS) APIs** (like file system access).
* **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Used for building a clean and beautiful **User Interface (UI)**.
