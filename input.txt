In lines of code, I find my peace,  
Where logic flows and doubts decrease.  
The world may fade, the screen may glow,  
But here I build, and watch it grow.  

A bug appears — my fleeting curse,  
A single line, the universe.  
Compile, crash, repeat again,  
Till chaos bends beneath my pen.  

Through sleepless nights and coffee streams,  
I chase the light inside my dreams.  
For every loop, a lesson learned,  
For every fail, a passion burned.  

And when the terminal goes still,  
I see my thoughts obey my will.  
The code runs clean, the world aligns,  
A poet’s heart in logic’s lines.  
In lines of code, I find my peace,

And when the terminal goes still,

A poet’s heart in logic’s lines.  
In lines of code, I find my peace,

The world may fade, the screen may glow,  
But here I build, and watch it grow.

A single line, the universe.  
Compile, crash, repeat again,  
Till chaos bends beneath my pen.

A bug appears — my fleeting curse,  
A single line, the universe.  
Compile, crash, repeat again,  
Till chaos bends beneath my pen.  

Through sleepless nights and coffee streams,  
I chase the light inside my dreams.  
For every loop, a lesson learned,  
For every fail, a passion burned.  

And when the terminal goes still,  
I see my thoughts obey my will.  
The code runs clean, the world aligns,  
A poet’s heart in logic’s lines.
